        and learning any new knowledge From: Hangzhou Zhejiang China`,
        part2Title: 'Aspire to be a full stack engineer who knows everything.',
        part2Content: `I am currently enrolled at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, 
        where I am pursuing my studies. Prior to this, I successfully completed 
        my bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Monash University. Throughout my academic journey in Australia,
         I have acquired a strong foundation of knowledge and essential skills that are applicable across various fields. Moreover,
          I have developed the ability to quickly grasp new information and adapt effectively within unfamiliar teams 
          and work environments.`,
        part3Title: 'About what I am doing now',
        part3Content: `As of July 2024, I am still studying for my postgraduate degree, 
        before which I am doing my internship in China, during which I try to complete this website, 
        and learn to use VUE.js and various plug-ins. I think it was a good exercise and experience, 
        and I also hope that the experience of building this page will help me in the future, 
        and I will keep updating this page and my github.`,
        part2018: `In 2018, I came to Melbourne, Australia for the first time. I began my study abroad life in Trinity college. 
        In an unfamiliar environment, I gradually learned to live alone, met new friends, learned new knowledge and 
        gradually adapted to a new learning mode. The transition from Chinese to Australian education was a huge change for me 
        and I had to get used to having to learn on my own rather than having someone push you.At the same time, I also need to 
        learn to manage my own time and every detail in my life. It was a big change for me`,
        part2019: `In 2019, I entered Monash University and began my undergraduate life. Compared with Trinity College, 
        the undergraduate courses were more streamlined, and my time in school was very limited. Meanwhile, compared with before, 
        it was difficult for me to find teachers to solve some problems, and more free time meant more difficult time management 
        and self-supervision. This year, I began to have extensive exposure to knowledge about software development, and these 
        knowledge made me realize the high-intensity Australian style of teaching. The professor is always responsible for lecturing, 
        and if I don't understand the rest of the knowledge, I have to spend a lot of time on self-study after class.
        Instead of having someone give you answers, and assignments change from writing little papers to writing programs. 
        All these brought me a lot of challenges, but fortunately, although it was difficult, I passed it perfectly.`,
        part2020To2021: `From 2020 to 2021, due to the epidemic, I have to take online courses in China. 
        Compared with the campus life in the first year, online courses are boring, and many online communication becomes 
        very inconvenient. The online course life in these two years is also beneficial. Because I study at home, 
        I can put more energy on my study instead of distracting some of my energy to my life.`,
        part2022: `In 2022, the epidemic almost ended, and my friends and I gradually returned to the campus. 
        The last year of campus life was very precious. Under the pressure of the graduation project, 
        we also allocated more time to explore the missing life of studying abroad in the two-year epidemic`,
        part2023: `In 2010, I chose to continue my master's degree in software development in University of Technology Sydney. 
        In this year, I moved from Melbourne to Sydney. The different environment brought me challenges and made me 
        experience the different atmosphere of different cities.`,
